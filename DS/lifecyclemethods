mounting - when the component instance is created in class

constructor  - to initialise state values and binding event handleers, super(props => incase to use props inside constructor using 'this' keyword)
static getderivedstatefromprops - if the state in constructor depends on the props passed ( this dont work as it is static) takes props and state as arguments and returns null or new state
render - to display the UI, pure function, child components can be called here
componentdidupdate - when the component and its all child components are rendered , perfect place for ajax req
nuances - called only after all of its child components are rendered.

updating - when the component is re -rendered 

constructor
static getderivedstatefromprops
shouldcomponentupdate(nextprops,next state ) - dictates whether it needed to be re rendered or not based on the comparison 
render -
static getsnapshotbeforeupdate - calls before immediately when virtual dom call happens. e.g. users scroll position reads from current dom state
componentdidupdate(prevprops,prevstate,snapshot)( calls after render is finished in re-render cycles)


componentwillunmount - invoked right after component is unmounted
does necessary clean up 
do not ever use setstate

error error boundaries
static getderivedstatefromError(error)
componentdidcatch(error,info)
during renering or constructor method
